This video isn’t about opinions.
It’s about timelines.

Native Americans lived on this land for more than ten thousand years.
Every other group arrived later — by land, by boat, or by force.

Time passing doesn’t change origin.
Longer stay doesn’t make someone original.

If you’re not Native American, you’re an immigrant.
That’s not shame.
That’s reality.
