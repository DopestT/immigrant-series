ep01_immigrant_definition,"This video isn’t about opinions. It’s about timelines. Native Americans lived on this land for more than ten thousand years. Every other group arrived later — by land, by boat, or by force. Time passing doesn’t change origin. Longer stay doesn’t make someone original. If you’re not Native American, you’re an immigrant. That’s not shame. That’s reality."
ep02_built_this_country,"When people say their family built this country, they usually skip who was already here. Indigenous nations had governments, agriculture, and trade long before Europeans arrived. Building something on taken land doesn’t make you original. Contribution doesn’t cancel colonization. Hard work doesn’t erase how the land was acquired."
ep03_slaves_built_wealth,"Enslaved Africans built the economic foundation of the United States. Cotton, tobacco, and sugar created enormous wealth. That wealth financed banks, ports, insurance companies, and industry. Enslaved people also built roads, ports, and parts of Washington, D.C. This country was not built by free labor. It was built by stolen labor."
ep04_asians_built_infrastructure,"Chinese immigrants built the Transcontinental Railroad. They worked longer hours, under more dangerous conditions, for less pay. Without them, westward expansion stalls. The economy doesn’t unify coast to coast. After the work was done, they were excluded by law. They built it — and were locked out of it."
ep05_border_crossed_them,"Some people didn’t cross a border. The border crossed them. In 1848, the United States took large portions of Mexico. Families already living there were suddenly labeled foreigners. You can’t immigrate into land your family already lived on."
ep06_take_labor_blame_people,"There’s a pattern in American history that keeps repeating. America takes the labor first. Indigenous people lose land. African slaves create wealth. Asian immigrants build infrastructure. Mexican labor sustains agriculture. Immigrants today keep food, healthcare, and logistics running. Then the work becomes inconvenient. The story changes. The workers become the problem. Their labor gets erased. Their presence gets framed as a threat. If every generation of workers becomes the problem after building the country, maybe the problem was never the workers. Maybe it’s the system that keeps doing this."
