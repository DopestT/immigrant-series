Enslaved Africans built the economic foundation of the United States.

Cotton, tobacco, and sugar created enormous wealth.
That wealth financed banks, ports, insurance companies, and industry.

Enslaved people also built roads, ports,
and parts of Washington, D.C.

This country was not built by free labor.
It was built by stolen labor.
