There’s a pattern in American history that keeps repeating.

America takes the labor first.
Indigenous people lose land.
African slaves create wealth.
Asian immigrants build infrastructure.
Mexican labor sustains agriculture.
Immigrants today keep food, healthcare, and logistics running.

Then the work becomes inconvenient.
The story changes.

The workers become the problem.
Their labor gets erased.
Their presence gets framed as a threat.

If every generation of workers becomes the problem
after building the country,
maybe the problem was never the workers.

Maybe it’s the system that keeps doing this.
