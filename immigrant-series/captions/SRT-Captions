1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There’s a pattern in American history that keeps repeating.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
America takes the labor first.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Indigenous people lose land.
African slaves create wealth.
Asian immigrants build infrastructure.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Mexican labor sustains agriculture.
Immigrants today keep food, healthcare,
and logistics running.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then the work becomes inconvenient.
The story changes.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The workers become the problem.
Their labor gets erased.
Their presence gets framed as a threat.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If every generation of workers becomes the problem
after building the country...

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Maybe the problem was never the workers.

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Maybe it’s the system that keeps doing this.
